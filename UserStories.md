# Time2Care â€“ User Stories & Development Roadmap

## ðŸ“Œ User Stories

### ðŸ”¹ As a Student
- I want to **create an account with profile info** (year level, section, group, profile picture) so that I am properly organized in the system.  
- I want to **receive my own QR code** that I can save and present for attendance.  
- I want to **view my schedule** so I can track when and where I am assigned.  
- I want to **get notifications** (email, website, or app alert) before my schedule or if it changes, so I donâ€™t miss duty.  
- I want to **see my attendance history** so I can verify my logs.  
- I want to **see motivational quotes** on login/homepage for encouragement.  
- I want to **see a calendar view** with icons (dot/heart/star) showing my scheduled duties so I can plan easily.

### ðŸ”¹ As a Teacher (CI)
- I want to **scan student QR codes** so I can record their attendance quickly.  
- I want to **view attendance tables** with names and timestamps, so monitoring is easy.  
- I want to **download/export attendance reports** (Excel/CSV) so I can keep records.  
- I want to **access my groupâ€™s schedules and attendance** in one place without hassle.

### ðŸ”¹ As an Admin
- I want to **create accounts for students and teachers** or approve self-registrations.  
- I want to **easily create and manage schedules** per group, so workload is reduced.  
- I want the system to **detect conflicts automatically** (highlight in red if a student already has a duty on that date/time) so no overlaps happen.  
- I want to **assign schedules per group** so that I donâ€™t need to manually select every student.  
- I want to **notify students automatically** (email, SMS, or Messenger) before their duty, so they donâ€™t miss schedules.  
- I want to **view all attendance logs in a table** (columns: student name, date, scan time) so monitoring is organized.  
- I want the **system dashboard to show schedules visually (calendar view)** with highlighted duty days per group, so itâ€™s easy to manage.
